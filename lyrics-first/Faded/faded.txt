Faded - EastCloud提供

Have you felt the memories were fading,
Just like photos losing colors. 
The pains, the tears. 
The laughters, the touches,
All become foggy and distant. 

Have you noticed the stories were fading,
Just like records losing grooves. 
The shared secretes, the private conversions. 
The exchanged souvenirs, the breathtaking adventures. 
All become soft and irrelevant. 

New wines filled the old bottle,
save it,
for the best moment yet to come. 
Time turns bitterness into subtlety,
Time filters painfulness into maturity. 

Standing in this river,
Willingly shaped by the mighty water. 
Ceased swimming in all directions,
Surrendering to the unidirectional force. 

Youth exchanged into wisdom,
My book is finally mine. 
New memories and stories emerge,
Only the best ones are kept.
