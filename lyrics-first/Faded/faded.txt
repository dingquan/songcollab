Faded - EastCloud提供

Have you felt the memories were fading,
Just like the photos losing colors. 
The pains, the tears. 
The laughters, the touches,
All become foggy and distant. 

Have you noticed the stories were fading,
Just like the records losing grooves. 
The shared secrets, and the souvenirs,  
All become soft and irrelevant. 

New wine filled the old bottles,
save it,
for the best moment yet to come. 
Time turns bitter into subtlety,
Time filters pain into maturity. 

Standing in this river,
Willingly shaped by the mighty water. 
Ceased swimming in all directions,
Surrendering to the unidirectional forces. 

Youth exchanged into wisdom,
My book is finally mine. 
New memories and stories emerge,
Only the best ones are kept.
