Solo trip - EastCloud提供

I want to travel alone:
Me and my pencil. 
To sketch the silhouettes of mountains, 
To pave the shadow of skyscrapers. 
To feel the snow flakes melting on fingertips,
To inhale the thin air from white summits. 

I want to travel alone:
Me and my notepad. 
To record the friendly flirts between non-strangers,
To describe the subtle transition from innocent to passionate. 
To be intoxicated by the smell of mixed spices,
To be surrounded by the music of impromptu artists. 

I want to travel alone:
Me and myself. 
To dance every note with emotional Chopin,
To savor every sip of aged Bordeaux. 
To walk all the alleys and boulevard and bridges,
To peruse every shop and bookstore and museum. 

Nobody loves me or hates me,
Nobody needs me or despises me. 
So every moment of life,
is as stunning as the first time.
